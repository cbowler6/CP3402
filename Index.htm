		<p>This website is to give feedback(both positive and negative) to teachers in a Reddit style. 
Both Students and teachers will be able to comment on posts and upvote and downvote them. This will bring the 
more important and shared thoughts to the forefront and encourage a discourse between students and teachers and 
encourage teachers to better their teaching. This will also allow students to thank teachers for their efforts.</p>
